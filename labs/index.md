This page links to lab activities.

You are required to complete the labs.  To receive credit for a lab, you must demonstrate it to me in class.  For full credit, demonstrate the lab by the end of the class following the class in which we started the lab.  For 80% of full credit, demonstrate the lab before the next exam.
