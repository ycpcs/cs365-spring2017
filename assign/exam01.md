This page has the instructions for getting started on Question 3 on Exam 1.  Note that the printed handout also has important information about the question, including hints and suggestions.

# Getting Started

These instructions assume you are using your VNC session on the cluster head node.

Run the following commands in a terminal:

<pre>
wget http://faculty.ycp.edu/~dhovemey/spring2017/cs365/<i>zipfile</i>
unzip <i>zipfile</i>
cd CS365_Exam01
</pre>

You will be adding your code to the file **something.c**.  Run `make` to compile.  See the printed handout for how to run and test the program.

## What information sources you can use

You can use any sources on or linked from the course web page.  The [MPI reference](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpi/www/www3/) will be useful.  You can also use your textbook, any written notes you have, and your labs and assignments.  Do **not** use any other information sources.

## Don't panic!

Partial credit will be assigned for a non-working program based on how close you were to having a working program. (However, having a working program is better than having a non-working program.)
